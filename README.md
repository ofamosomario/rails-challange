# Case:
Improve the existing UsersController to add the missing REST methods For GET /users/:id (show method) we also want to return the created_at date time.
Add one more resource: Loan, implement it’s CRUD using the same architecture Create some relationship between User and Loan Improve/write tests
We only did a simple test for the model and none for the request itself. Can you improve this for us? Fell free to add and configure any library
